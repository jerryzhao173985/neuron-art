# Changelog - Neural Illumination Enhancements

## Latest Improvements (Based on Your Feedback)

### ‚úÖ Slower, More Observable Pacing

**Problem:** Training was too fast to observe details
**Solution:**
- Phase transition speed reduced from `0.02` ‚Üí `0.012` (40% slower)
- Each forward/backward cycle now takes ~40-50 seconds (was ~25 seconds)
- More time to observe particle flow, neuron effects, and gradient propagation

### ‚úÖ More Training Data

**Problem:** Dataset was too small, training finished too quickly
**Solution:**
- Training samples: 100 ‚Üí **240 samples** (2.4√ó more data)
- Test samples: 20 ‚Üí **40 samples** (2√ó more data)
- More diverse shapes with greater variety

### ‚úÖ Longer Training Period

**Problem:** Training completed too quickly, didn't show full convergence
**Solution:**
- Total epochs: 100 ‚Üí **200 epochs** (2√ó longer)
- Better observation of learning progression
- Can see plateaus, convergence, and fine-tuning phases

### ‚úÖ Clear Phase Indicator

**Problem:** Unclear what forward vs backward passes actually represent
**Solution:**
- **NEW**: Large indicator box at top of canvas
- Shows current phase: "‚¨Ü FORWARD PASS" or "‚¨á BACKWARD PASS"
- Explains what's happening:
  - Forward: "Processing batch through network ‚Üí Computing predictions"
  - Backward: "Computing gradients ‚Üí Updating all 1,074 weights"
- Progress bar showing phase completion
- Color-coded borders (blue for forward, orange for backward)

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Statistics

**Problem:** Statistics didn't show batch information
**Solution:**
- Now shows: `Epoch: 45 / 200 (22.5%)`
- Displays batch size: `Batch size: 16 samples`
- Shows percentage completion
- More informative training progress

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Documentation

**Problem:** Unclear what the visual phases represent in actual training
**Solution:**
- **NEW**: `TRAINING_PROCESS.md` - Complete explanation of:
  - What forward pass really means (batch processing)
  - What backward pass really means (gradient computation + weight updates)
  - Why visualization alternates between them
  - How timing relates to reality (slowed 40,000√ó)
  - Technical details of mini-batch gradient descent
  - Observing convergence across epochs

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ‚ö° Fast-paced (hard to follow)
- üìä Limited data (quickly overfit)
- üèÅ Quick completion (100 epochs in ~40 minutes at 1√ó speed)
- ‚ùì Unclear phase meaning
- üìà Basic statistics

### After
- üê¢ Measured pace (easier to observe)
- üìä Rich data (better learning trajectory)
- üéØ Full training arc (200 epochs in ~2.5 hours at 1√ó speed)
- ‚úÖ **Crystal clear phase explanation**
- üìà Detailed statistics with progress tracking

## What Each Phase Means (Now Clear!)

### ‚¨Ü Forward Pass
**Visual:** White/blue particles flowing upward
**Reality:** Processing a batch of 16 samples through network
**Computes:** Predictions for each sample, average loss
**Result:** "Here's what the network currently predicts"

### ‚¨á Backward Pass
**Visual:** Red/orange particles flowing downward
**Reality:** Computing gradients via backpropagation
**Updates:** All 1,074 parameters using gradient descent
**Result:** "Network weights are now improved"

### üîÑ One Complete Cycle
Forward ‚Üí Backward = Process one batch and update weights
Multiple cycles = One epoch (240 samples √∑ 16 per batch = 15 cycles per epoch)

## Recommendations for Viewing

### First-Time Viewers
1. **Watch at default speed** (Training Speed = 3)
   - One epoch ‚âà 6-8 minutes
   - Full 200 epochs ‚âà 20-25 hours
   - **Recommended**: Watch for 30 minutes, see 4-5 epochs

2. **Enable "Show Math"** after first observation
   - See exact calculations
   - Verify it's real training
   - Understand the formulas

3. **Open browser console** (F12)
   - See training logs every 10 epochs
   - Watch weight changes
   - Verify convergence

### Adjusted Speed Options

| Speed | One Epoch | 200 Epochs | Best For |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 1√ó | ~20 min | ~65 hours | Detailed study |
| 3√ó (default) | ~7 min | ~22 hours | Comfortable viewing |
| 5√ó | ~4 min | ~13 hours | Patient observation |
| 10√ó | ~2 min | ~7 hours | Full training run |

**Tip**: Start at 3√ó, increase to 10√ó once you understand the flow!

- [ ] **Layer-by-layer mode**: Pause at each layer during forward/backward
- [ ] **Gradient magnitude graph**: Show gradient norms over time per layer
- [ ] **Weight histogram**: Distribution of weight values evolving
- [ ] **Activation patterns**: Heatmap of hidden layer activations
- [ ] **Export video**: Record training as MP4 file
- [ ] **Compare seeds**: Side-by-side training with different initializations

Let me know if you want any of these! üöÄ
